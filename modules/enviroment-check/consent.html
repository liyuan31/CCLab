            <p><strong>Study Title: Online Studies of Attentional Control</strong></p>
            <p><strong>Protocol Number: 2020E1288</strong></p>
            <p><strong>Researcher: Andrew B. Leber, Ph.D.</strong></p>
            <p><strong>Sponsor: National Science Foundation</strong></p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p><strong>This is a consent form for research participation.&nbsp; </strong>It contains important
                information about
                this study and what to expect if you decide to participate.</p>
            <p><strong>Your participation is voluntary.</strong></p>
            <p>Please consider the information carefully. Feel free to ask questions before making your decision whether
                or not
                to participate.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p><strong>Purpose:</strong></p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>This research is intended to address questions about human attentional control. &nbsp;Your behavioral
                data will
                contribute to answering these questions and will be greatly appreciated.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p><strong>Procedures/Tasks:</strong></p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>Your participation involves watching various visual events on a computer screen and responding to what
                you
                saw.&nbsp; Additionally, you may be asked to complete a survey. You will be provided with detailed
                verbal
                instructions via a video call when you are seated at the computer in your own location. &nbsp;We will
                end the
                video call before the experiment starts.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p><strong>Duration: </strong>This experiment will be approximately 30-60 minutes in duration.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>You may leave the study at any time.&nbsp; If you decide to stop participating in the study, there will
                be no
                penalty to you, and you will not lose any benefits to which you are otherwise entitled.&nbsp; Your
                decision will
                not affect your future relationship with The Ohio State University.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p><strong>Risks and Benefits:</strong></p>
            <p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
            <p>There is no more risk associated with participation than you would normally encounter while playing a
                simple
                video game for an hour.&nbsp; Benefits include advance scientific knowledge, experiencing the research
                process,
                and learning about attention and cognitive control (via debriefing).</p>
            <p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
            <p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
            <p>Confidentiality:</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>We will work to make sure that no one sees your online responses without approval. But, because we are
                using the
                Internet, there is a chance that someone could access your online responses without permission. In some
                cases,
                this information could be used to identify you.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>Also, there may be circumstances where this information must be released.&nbsp; For example, personal
                information
                regarding your participation in this study may be disclosed if required by state law.&nbsp; Also, your
                records
                may be reviewed by the following groups (as applicable to the research):</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Office for Human Research Protections or other federal, state, or international regulatory agencies;
                </li>

            </ul>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p><strong>Future Research:</strong></p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>Your de-identified information may be used or shared with other researchers without your additional
                informed
                consent.</p>

            <p><strong>Incentives:</strong></p>

                otherwise
